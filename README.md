# Gender-Detection Model

 Hi this is Manan Jain, pursuing my undergrad at IIT Kanpur, India.
 This i a gender detection model made using CNN models to detect gender of people which are identified using Haar Cascade classifier. Haar cascade classifier detects faces excluding hair and makes a box around it. The CNN model than classify it as Male or Female.

 I have also made a live detection application that uses the haar cascade algorithm to detect faces in live camera and tells its gender.
 The model has an accuracy of 89%.
